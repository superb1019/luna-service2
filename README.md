Summary
-------
Open webOS Luna System Bus library, daemon, and utilities

Description
-----------

Luna-service2 provides a bus-based IPC mechanism used between components in
webOS. Luna-service2 is composed of a client library and a central hub daemon.
The client library provides API support to register on the bus and communicate
with other components. The hub provides a central clearinghouse for all
communication. Utilities for monitoring and debugging the bus are included.

How to Build on Linux
=====================

## Dependencies

Below are the tools and libraries (and their minimum versions) required to build
_luna-service2_:

* cmake (version required by webosose/cmake-modules-webos)
* gcc 4.7.0
* glib-2.0 2.32.1
* make (any version)
* webosose/cmake-modules-webos 1.2.0
* webosose/libpbnjson 2.13.0
* webosose/libpbnjson_cpp 2.13.0
* webosose/PmLogLib 3.0.2
* pkg-config 0.26

Below are the tools (and their minimum versions) required to test _luna-service2_:

* gtest 1.7.0

## Building

Once you have downloaded the source, enter the following to build it (after
changing into the directory under which it was downloaded):

    $ mkdir BUILD
    $ cd BUILD
    $ cmake ..
    $ make
    $ sudo make install

The directory under which the files are installed defaults to `/usr/local/webos`.
You can install them elsewhere by supplying a value for `WEBOS_INSTALL_ROOT`
when invoking `cmake`. For example:

    $ cmake -D WEBOS_INSTALL_ROOT:PATH=$HOME/projects/webosose ..
    $ make
    $ make install

will install the files in subdirectories of `$HOME/projects/webosose`.

Specifying `WEBOS_INSTALL_ROOT` also causes `pkg-config` to look in that tree
first before searching the standard locations. You can specify additional
directories to be searched prior to this one by setting the `PKG_CONFIG_PATH`
environment variable.

If not specified, `WEBOS_INSTALL_ROOT` defaults to `/usr/local/webos`.

To configure for a debug build treating warnings as errors, enter:

    $ cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Debug -D WEBOS_USE_WERROR:BOOL=TRUE ..

To see a list of the make targets that `cmake` has generated, enter:

    $ make help

## Uninstalling

From the directory where you originally ran `make install`, enter:

    $ [sudo] make uninstall

You will need to use `sudo` if you did not specify `WEBOS_INSTALL_ROOT`.

## Generating Documentation

The tools required to generate the documentation are:

- doxygen 1.7.6.1
- graphviz 2.26.3

To generate the documentation, add `-D WEBOS_CONFIG_BUILD_DOCS:BOOL=TRUE` to the `cmake`
command line and make the `docs` target:

    $ cmake -D WEBOS_CONFIG_BUILD_DOCS:BOOL=TRUE <other-args> ..
    $ make docs

To view the generated HTML documentation, point your browser to
`Documentation/ls2/doc/*/index.html`

## Testing

To enable tests add `-D WEBOS_CONFIG_BUILD_TESTS:BOOL=TRUE` to the `cmake`
command line. Add `-D WEBOS_GTEST_SRCDIR:STRING=/path/to/gtest` to specify path
to gtest source directory, default is `WEBOS_INSTALL_ROOT/src/gtest`.

    $ cmake -DWEBOS_CONFIG_BUILD_TESTS=TRUE \
      -DWEBOS_GTEST_SRCDIR=/path/to/gtest <other-args> ..
    $ make test

## Coverage

To test coverage, add `-D WEBOS_USE_GCOV:BOOL=TRUE` or `-D WEBOS_GCOVR_REPORT:PATH=some_path.txt`,
where path is previous coverage result. Latter adds `coverage` target, which
requires `gcov` and `gcovr`, to collect coverage data.

To get general result, use:

    $ make ExperimentalCoverage

To get more detailed gcovr report, place old coverage data at
**@CMAKE_BUILD_DIR@/some_path.txt** and run:

    $ make coverage

Or run coverage script directly with optional parameter - previous coverage
result. The script will compare current coverage result with the previous one.

    $ ./coverage prev_coverage_result.txt

Coverage report is generated every time the script runs at
**@CMAKE_BUILD_DIR@/coverage_result.txt**
